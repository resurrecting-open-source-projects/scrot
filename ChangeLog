Wed Mar 12 13:20:11 GMT 2003  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>

  * Patch from Claes Nasten <pekdon@gmx.net>
  * Enhances thumbnail related options:
  "First, specifying -t would break the $f param to -exec.
   Second, the thumbnail and the screenshot got different timestamps.
   Third, one weren't able to specify geometry with -t.

   I fixed those and added, $m ( mini, instead of $t as it was taken ) so
   that one can do.

   $ scrot -t 91x0 -e 'echo $f,$m'
   2003-03-08-104735_800x600_scrot.png,2003-03-08-104735_91x68_scrot-thumb.png`

   About the geometry, having either the width or height set to 0 makes it
   fill in the other pertaining the aspect ratio.
  "
  * Once I update the docs I'll release 0.8

Tue Feb 25 13:13:03 GMT 2003  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>

Sat Feb 23 12:37:29 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>

  * Patch from Eric Z. Ayers <eric.ayers@compgen.com>
  * Changes the cursor to a bottom left corner when you start to drag to
    select a grab region.

Thu Jan 11 17:43:19 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Patch from Michael Roberts <m.t.roberts@student.murdoch.edu.au>
        to add -t, --thumb option to generate thumbnails. I modified it a
	little, specify the percentage size of the thumbnail on the
	command line.

Mon Dec  4 23:46:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Added -m, --multidisp, which is for multiple heads (not xinerama)
	grabs shots from each and joins them together.
	* Fixed doing the string escapes when saving files. My bad.


Sun Nov 12 15:16:40 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Now uses giblib. You'll need the very latest giblib from CVS as
	of right now.

Sun Nov  5 02:17:57 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Beep when about to take the shot.
	* Added -b, --border to grab wm borders too.
	* Ungrab mouse, keyboard before sleeping for --delay.
	* -e 'feh &f' is not intuitive. Can't use '%' cos that's reserved
	for strftime, so now the internal format specifiers are prefixed
	'$'. Trouble is, you now _must_ use '', not "", or the shell will
	interpret the $ sign and perform variable
	substitution. Suggestions?
	* Purged boring debugging shit.

Mon Oct 30 18:54:05 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* I can't be arsed to type all this again, so here's the new
	manpage entries:
	* If [file] is not specified, a date-stamped file will be
	dropped in the current directory.
	* SPECIAL STRINGS
	Both the --exec and filename parameters  can  take  format
        specifiers  that  are  expanded by scrot when encountered.
        There are two types of format specifier.  Characters
        preceded  by  a  '%' are interpreted by strftime(2). See man
        strftime for examples.  These options may be used to refer
        to  the current date and time.  The second kind are internal
        to scrot and are prefixed by '&' The following  specifiers
        are recognised:
        &f image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)
        &n image name (ignored when used in the filename)
        &s image size (bytes) (ignored when used in the filename)
        &p image pixel size
        &w image width
        &h image height
        &t image format
        && prints a literal '&'
        \n prints a newline (ignored when used in the filename)
        EXAMPLE
        scrot '%Y-%m-%d_&wx&h.png' -e 'mv &f ~/shots/'
        This  would  create   a   file   called   something   like
        2000-10-30_2560x1024.png  and move it to your shots directory.


Sun Oct 29 01:02:16 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Added -q, --quality for setting compression quality.

Fri Oct 27 21:01:45 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Added -s, --select. Let's you pick which window to grab by
	clicking on it, or you can draw a rectangle and grab that area :-)
	Also, while scrot has the mouse grabbed, hitting any key will
	cancel the shot and release it.
	* Plus, something import won't do, if you set a delay, you can
	choose the window or area first, then the delay occurs before the
	shot is taken.

Thu Oct 26 20:37:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Patch from richlowe to show countdown with delay (-c,
	--count). Cheers bud.

Thu Oct 26 15:22:22 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Added -d, --delay option to wait before shooting.

Thu Oct 26 14:09:52 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Created scrot.
