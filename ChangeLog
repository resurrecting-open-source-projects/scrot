  * Patch from Claes Nasten <pekdon@gmx.net>
  * Enhances thumbnail related options:
  "First, specifying -t would break the $f param to -exec.
   Second, the thumbnail and the screenshot got different timestamps.
   Third, one weren't able to specify geometry with -t.
  
   I fixed those and added, $m ( mini, instead of $t as it was taken ) so
   that one can do.
  
   $ scrot -t 91x0 -e 'echo $f,$m'

   About the geometry, having either the width or height set to 0 makes it
   fill in the other pertaining the aspect ratio.
  "
  * Once I update the docs I'll release 0.8

Tue Feb 25 13:13:03 GMT 2003  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>

  * release 0.7

Sat Feb 23 12:37:29 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Patch from Michael Roberts <m.t.roberts@student.murdoch.edu.au>
        to add -t, --thumb option to generate thumbnails. I modified it a
	little, specify the percentage size of the thumbnail on the
	commandline.

Mon Dec  4 23:46:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Adde -m, --multidisp, which is for multiple heads (not xinerama)
	grabs shots from each and joins them together.
	* Fixed doing the string escapes when saving files. My bad.


Sun Nov 12 15:16:40 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Now uses giblib. You'll need the very latest giblib from CVS as
	of right now.

Sun Nov  5 02:17:57 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Beep when about to take the shot.
	* Added -b, --border to grab wm borders too.
	* Ungrab mouse, keyboard before sleeping for --delay.
	* -e 'feh &f' is not intuitive. Can't use '%' cos that's reserved
	for strftime, so now the internal format specifiers are prefixed
	'$'. Trouble is, you now _must_ use '', not "", or the shell will
	interpret the $ sign and perform variable
	substiution. Suggestions?
	* Purged boring debugging shit.

Mon Oct 30 18:54:05 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* I can't be arsed to type all this again, so here's the new
	manpage entrys:
	* If [file] is not specified, a date-stamped file will be
	dropped in the current directory.
	* SPECIAL STRINGS
	Both the --exec and filename parameters  can  take  format
        specifiers  that  are  expanded by scrot when encountered.
        There are two types of format specifier.  Characters  pre-
        ceded  by  a  '%' are interpretted by strftime(2). See man
        strftime for examples.  These options may be used to refer
        to  the current date and time.  The second kind are inter-
        nal to scrot and are prefixed by '&' The following  speci-
        fiers are recognised:
        &f image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)
        &n image name (ignored when used in the filename)
        &s image size (bytes) (ignored when used in the filename)
        &p image pixel size
        &w image width
        &h image height
        &t image format
        && prints a literal '&'
        \n prints a newline (ignored when used in the filename)
        EXAMPLE
        scrot '%Y-%m-%d_&wx&h.png' -e 'mv &f ~/shots/'
        This  would  create   a   file   called   something   like
        2000-10-30_2560x1024.png  and move it to your shots direc-
        tory.
	

Sun Oct 29 01:02:16 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Added -q, --quality for setting compression quality.

Fri Oct 27 21:01:45 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Added -s, --select. Let's you pick which window to grab by
	clicking on it, or you can draw a rectangle and grab that area :-)
	Also, while scrot has the mouse grabbed, hitting any key will
	cancel the shot and release it.
	* Plus, something import won't do, if you set a delay, you can
	choose the window or area first, then the delay occurs before the
	shot is taken.

Thu Oct 26 20:37:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Patch from richlowe to show countdown with delay (-c,
	--count). Cheers bud.

Thu Oct 26 15:22:22 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Added -d, --delay option to wait before shooting.

Thu Oct 26 14:09:52 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>

	* Created scrot.
