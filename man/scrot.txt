NAME
  scrot - command line screen capture utility

SYNOPSIS
  scrot [-bcfhimopuvz] [-a X,Y,W,H] [-C NAME] [-D DISPLAY] [-d SEC] [-e CMD]
        [-k OPT] [-l STYLE] [-M NUM] [-n OPTS] [-q NUM] [-s OPTS] [-t % | WxH]
        [-w NUM] [[-F] FILE]

DESCRIPTION
  scrot (SCReenshOT) is a simple command line screen capture utility, it uses
  imlib2 to grab and save images.

  scrot has many useful features:
    - Support for multiple image formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, and others.
    - The screenshot's quality is configurable.
    - It is possible to capture a specific window or a rectangular area on the
      screen.

  Because scrot is a command line utility, it can easily be scripted and put to
  novel uses. For instance, scrot can be used to monitor an X server in absence.

  scrot is free software under the MIT-feh license.

OPTIONS
  -a, --autoselect X,Y,W,H  Non-interactively choose a rectangle starting at
                            position X,Y and of W by H resolution.
  -b, --border              When selecting a window, grab the WM's border too.
                            Use with -s to raise the focus of the window.
  -C, --class NAME          NAME is a window class name. Associative with -k.
  -c, --count               Display a countdown when used with -d.
  -D, --display DISPLAY     DISPLAY is the display to use; see X(7).
  -d, --delay [b]SEC        Wait SEC seconds before taking a shot.
                            When given the `b` prefix, e.g `-d b8`, the delay
                            will be applied before selection.
  -e, --exec CMD            Execute CMD on the saved image.
  -F, --file FILE           Specify the output file. If FILE is "-", scrot will
                            output the image to stdout. The filename is
                            expanded according to the format specified in
                            SPECIAL STRINGS. The output file may be specified
                            through the -F option, or as a non-option argument.
  -f, --freeze              Freeze the screen when -s is used.
  -h, --help                Display help and exit.
  -i, --ignorekeyboard      Don't exit for keyboard input. ESC still exits.
  -k, --stack[=OPT]         Capture stack/overlapped windows and join them. A
                            running Composite Manager is needed for it to work
                            correctly. OPT is optional join letter: v/h
                            (vertical/horizontal). Default: h
  -l, --line STYLE          STYLE indicates the style of the line when the -s
                            option is used; see SELECTION STYLE.
  -M, --monitor NUM         Capture Xinerama monitor number NUM.
  -m, --multidisp           For multiple heads, screenshot all of them in order.
  -o, --overwrite           By default scrot does not overwrite the output
                            FILE, use this option to enable it.
  -p, --pointer             Capture the mouse pointer.
  -q, --quality NUM         NUM must be within [1, 100]. A higher value
                            represents better quality image and a lower value
                            represents worse quality image. Effect of this flag
                            depends on the file format, see COMPRESSION QUALITY
                            section. Default: 75.
  -s, --select[=OPTS]       Interactively select a window or rectangle with the
                            mouse, use the arrow keys to resize. See the -l and
                            -f options. OPTS it's optional; see SELECTION MODE
  -t, --thumb % | WxH       Also generate a thumbnail. The argument represents
                            the thumbnail's resolution: if the argument is a
                            single number, it is a percentage of the full size
                            screenshot's resolution; if it is 2 numbers
                            separated by an "x" character, it is a resolution.
                            If one of the resolution's dimensions is 0, it is
                            replaced by a number that maintains the full size
                            screenshot's aspect ratio. Examples: 10, 25, 320x240,
                            500x200, 100x0, 0x480.
  -u, --focused, --focussed Use the currently focused window.
  -v, --version             Output version information and exit.
  -w, --window WID          Window identifier to capture.
                            WID must be a valid identifier (see xwininfo(1)).
  -Z, --compression LVL     Compression level to use, LVL must be within
                            [0, 9]. Higher level compression provides lower file
                            size at the cost of slower encoding/saving speed.
                            Effect of this flag depends on the file format, see
                            COMPRESSION QUALITY section. Default: 7.
  -z, --silent              Prevent beeping.
  --format FMT              Specify the output file format. E.g "--format png".
                            If no format is specified, scrot will use the file
                            extension to determine the format. If filename
                            does not have an extension either, then PNG will
                            be used as fallback.
  --list-options[=OPT]      List all program options. If argument is "tsv" it
                            outputs a TAB separated list intended for scripts.
                            Default is "human". Note that the tsv format is not
                            stable and may change in the future.

SPECIAL STRINGS
  -e, -F and FILE parameters can take format specifiers that are expanded
  by scrot when encountered. There are two types of format specifier:
  Characters preceded by a '%' are interpreted by strftime(3). The second kind
  are internal to scrot and are prefixed by '$'. The following specifiers are
  recognised by scrot:

    $$   A literal '$'.
    $a   The system's hostname.
    $F   The output file format.
    $f   The image's full path (ignored when used in the filename).
    $h   The image's height.
    $m   The thumbnail's full path (ignored when used in the filename).
    $n   The image's basename (ignored when used in the filename).
    $p   The image's pixel size.
    $s   The image's size in bytes (ignored when used in the filename).
    $t   The image's file format (ignored when used in the filename).
    $w   The image's width.
    $W   The name of the window (only for --select, --focused and --window).
    \\n   A literal newline (ignored when used in the filename).

  Example:

    $ scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h.png' -e 'du -h $f'

  This would create a PNG file with a name similar to 2000-10-30_2560x1024.png
  and show the disk-usage with du(1).

SELECTION MODE
  When using -s, optionally you can indicate the action to perform with the selection area.
  Some actions allow optional parameters too.

    capture             Capture the selection area, this action is by default and
                        does not need to be specified.

    hole                Highlight the selected area overshadowing the rest of the capture.

    hide,IMAGE          Hide the selection area by drawing an area of color (or image) over it.
                        Optionally indicate name of the image to use as cover.
                        Image has priority over color.

    blur,AMOUNT         Blurs the selection area.
                        Optionally you can specify the amount of blur.
                        Amount must be within [1, 30]. Default: 18.

  In modes 'hole' and 'hide' the color of the area is indicated by 'color' property of the
  line style and the opacity of the color (or image) is indicated by property 'opacity', SELECTION STYLE

  If the 'hide' mode uses an image that does not have an alpha channel, the opacity parameter
  will be ignored and it will be drawn fully opaque.

  Examples:

    $ scrot --select=hide
    $ scrot -shole --line color="Dark Salmon",opacity=200
    $ scrot -sblur,10
    $ scrot -shide,stamp.png --line opacity=120

SELECTION STYLE
  When using -s, you can indicate the style of the line with -l.

  -l takes a comma-separated list of specifiers as argument:

    style=STYLE     STYLE is either "solid" or "dash" without quotes.

    width=NUM       NUM is a pixel count within [1, 8].

    color="COLOR"   Color is a hexadecimal HTML color code or the name of
                    a color. HTML color codes are composed of a pound
                    sign '#' followed by a sequence of 3 2-digit
                    hexadecimal numbers which represent red, green, and
                    blue respectively. Examples: #FF0000 (red), #E0FFFF
                    (light cyan), #000000 (black).

    opacity=NUM     NUM is within [0, 255]. 255 means 100% opaque, 0 means
                    100% transparent. For the opacity of the line, this is only
                    effective if the compositor supports _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY.

    mode=MODE       MODE can be "auto", "edge" or "classic" without quotes.
                    edge is the new selection, classic uses the old one.
                    "auto" uses "edge" if no compositor is running, "classic"
                    otherwise. "edge" ignores the style specifier and the -f flag,
                    "classic" ignores the opacity specifier.

  Without the -l option, a default style is used:

    mode=auto,style=solid,width=1,opacity=100

  Example:

    $ scrot -l style=dash,width=3,color="red" -s

COMPRESSION QUALITY

For lossless formats (e.g PNG), the quality options is ignored. For lossy
formats where the quality and compression are tied together (e.g JPEG),
compression will be ignored. And for image formats where quality and
compression can be independently set (e.g WebP, JXL), both flags are respected.

EXAMPLES

Following are a couple examples of using scrot with other utilities.

Copying screenshot to clipboard using xclip(1):

  $ scrot - | xclip -selection clipboard -target image/png

Taking a screenshot and optimizing its size with optipng(1):

  $ scrot -e 'optipng -o4 $f'

Selecting a window by PID with xdo(1):

  $ scrot -w $(xdo id -p PID)

Taking a screenshot and annotating it with ImageMagick(1):

 $ scrot - | convert -pointsize 64 -gravity North -annotate '+16+16' 'hello, world!' - out.png
