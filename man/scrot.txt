NAME
  scrot - command line screen capture utility

SYNOPSIS
  scrot [-bcfhikmopsuvz] [-a X,Y,W,H] [-C NAME] [-D DISPLAY] [-d SEC] [-e CMD]
        [-F FILE] [-l STYLE] [-n OPTS] [-q NUM] [-S CMD] [-t NUM | GEOM] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
  scrot (SCReenshOT) is a simple command line screen capture utility, it uses
  imlib2 to grab and save images.

  scrot has many useful features:
    - Support for multiple image formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, and others.
    - The screenshot's quality is configurable.
    - It is possible to capture a specific window or a rectangular area on the
      screen.

  Because scrot is a command line utility, it can easily be scripted and put to
  novel uses. For instance, scrot can be used to monitor an X server in absence.

  scrot is free software under the MIT-advertising license.

OPTIONS
  -a, --autoselect X,Y,W,H  Non-interactively choose a rectangle starting at
                            position X,Y and of W by H resolution.
  -b, --border              When selecting a window, grab the WM's border too.
                            Use with -s to raise the focus of the window.
  -C, --class NAME          NAME is a window class name. Associative with -k.
  -c, --count               Display a countdown when used with -d.
  -D, --display DISPLAY     DISPLAY is the display to use; see X(7).
  -d, --delay SEC           Wait SEC seconds before taking a shot.
  -e, --exec CMD            Execute CMD on the saved image.
  -f, --freeze              Freeze the screen when -s is used.
  -F, --file                File name. See SPECIAL STRINGS.
  -h, --help                Display help and exit.
  -i, --ignorekeyboard      Don't exit for keyboard input. ESC still exits.
  -k, --stack               Capture stack/overlapped windows and join them. A
                            running Composite Manager is needed.
  -l, --line STYLE          STYLE indicates the style of the line when the -s
                            option is used; see SELECTION STYLE.
  -m, --multidisp           For multiple heads, screenshot all of them in order.
  -n, --note OPTS           OPTS is a collection of options which specify notes
                            to bake into the image. See NOTE FORMAT.
  -o, --overwrite           By default scrot does not overwrite the output
                            FILE, use this option to enable it.
  -p, --pointer             Capture the mouse pointer.
  -q, --quality NUM         NUM must be between 1 and 100. For lossless output
                            formats, a higher value represents better but slower
                            compression. For lossy output formats, a higher
                            value represents higher quality and larger
                            file size. Default: 75.
  -S, --script CMD          CMD is an imlib2 script.
  -s, --select OPT          Interactively select a window or rectangle with the
                            mouse, use the arrow keys to resize. See the -l and
                            -f options. OPT it's optional; see SELECTION MODE
  -t, --thumb NUM | GEOM    Also generate a thumbnail. The argument is the
                            resolution of the thumbnail, it may be a percentage
                            NUM or a resolution GEOM. Examples: 10, 25, 320x240,
                            500x200.
  -u, --focused             Use the currently focused window.
  -v, --version             Output version information and exit.
  -z, --silent              Prevent beeping.
  -                         Redirection to standard output. The output image
                            format is PNG.

SPECIAL STRINGS
  -e, -F and FILE parameters can take format specifiers that are expanded
  by scrot when encountered. There are two types of format specifier:
  Characters preceded by a '%' are interpreted by strftime(2). The second kind
  are internal to scrot and are prefixed by '$'. The following specifiers are
  recognised by scrot:

    $$   A literal '$'.
    $a   The system's hostname.
    $f   The image's full path (ignored when used in the filename).
    $h   The image's height.
    $m   The thumbnail's full path (ignored when used in the filename).
    $n   The image's basename (ignored when used in the filename).
    $p   The image's pixel size.
    $s   The image's size in bytes (ignored when used in the filename).
    $t   The image's file format (ignored when used in the filename).
    $w   The image's width.
    \\n   A literal newline (ignored when used in the filename).

  Example:

    $ scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h.png' -e 'optipng $f'

  This would create a PNG file with a name similar to 2000-10-30_2560x1024.png
  and optimize it with optipng(1).

SELECTION MODE
  When using -s, optionally you can indicate the action to perform with the selection area.
  Note: Parameters @OPACITY, @AMOUNT and @IMAGE are optional.

    capture             Capture the selection area, this action is by default.

    hole@OPACITY        Highlight the selected area overshadowing the rest of the capture.
                        Opacity, range: 0..255, default: 100

    hide@OPACITY@IMAGE  Hide the selection area by drawing an area of color(or image) over it.
                        Opacity, range 0..255, default: 100
                        Image file name, Note: @OPACITY is required in this case.

    blur@AMOUNT         Blurs the selection area.
                        Amount,range: 1..30,  default: 18

  In modes hole and hide the color of the area is indicated by "color" property of the
  line style, SELECTION STYLE

  Example:

    $ scrot --select=hide
    $ scrot -shole --line color="Dark Salmon"
    $ scrot -sblur@10
    $ scrot -shide@255@stamp.png

SELECTION STYLE
  When using -s, you can indicate the style of the line with -l.

  -l takes a comma-separated list of specifiers as argument:

    style=STYLE     STYLE is either "solid" or "dash" without quotes.
    width=NUM       NUM is a pixel count between 1 and 8 inclusive.
    color="COLOR"   Color is a hexadecimal HTML color code or the name of
                    a color. HTML color codes are composed of a pound
                    sign '#' followed by a sequence of 3 2-digit
                    hexadecimal numbers which represent red, green, and
                    blue respectively. Examples: #FF0000 (red), #E0FFFF
                    (light cyan), #000000 (black).
    opacity=NUM     NUM is between 0 and 255 inclusive. 255 means
                    100% opaque, 0 means 100% transparent. For the
                    opacity of the line this is only effective if a
                    Composite Manager is running.
    mode=MODE       MODE is either "edge" or "classic" without quotes.
                    edge is the new selection, classic uses the old one.
                    "edge" ignores the style specifier and the -f flag,
                    "classic" ignores the opacity specifier.

  Without the -l option, a default style is used:

    mode=classic,style=solid,width=1,opacity=100

  Example:

    $ scrot -l style=dash,width=3,color="red" -s

NOTE FORMAT
  The -n option's argument is more arguments:

    -f  'FontName/size'
    -t  'text'
    -x  position (optional)
    -y  position (optional)
    -c  color(RGBA, range 0..255) (optional)
    -a  angle (optional)

  Example:

    $ scrot -n "-f '/usr/share/fonts/TTF/DroidSans-Bold/40' -x 10
            -y 20 -c 255,0,0,255 -t 'Hi'"
