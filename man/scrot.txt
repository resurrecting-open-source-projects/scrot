NAME
  scrot - command line screen capture utility

SYNOPSIS
  scrot [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
  scrot (SCReenshOT) is a simple command line screen capture
  utility that uses imlib2 to grab and save images. Multiple
  image formats are supported through imlib2's dynamic saver
  modules.

  Some features of the scrot:
    - support to multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.).
    - optimization of the screen shots image quality.
    - capture a specific window or a rectangular area on the
      screen with the help of switch.

  scrot also can be used to monitor a desktop PC in admin absent
  and register unwanted activities.

SPECIAL STRINGS
  Both the --exec and filename parameters can take format specifiers that are
  expanded by scrot when encountered. There are two types of format specifier.
  Characters preceded by a '%' are interpreted by strftime(2). See man strftime
  for examples. These options may be used to refer to the current date and
  time. The second kind are internal to scrot and are prefixed by '$' The
  following specifiers are recognised:

    $a  hostname
    $f  image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)
    $m  thumb image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)
    $n  image name (ignored when used in the filename)
    $s  image size (bytes) (ignored when used in the filename)
    $p  image pixel size
    $w  image width
    $h  image height
    $t  image format (ignored when used in the filename)
    $$  print a literal '$'
    \\n  print a newline (ignored when used in the filename)

  Example:

    $ scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h.png' -e 'mv $f ~/shots/'

  This would create a file called something like 2000-10-30_2560x1024.png
  and move it to your shots directory.

SELECTION STYLE
  When using --select you can indicate the style of the line with --line.

  The following specifiers are recognised:

    style=(solid,dash),width=(range 1 to 8),color="value",
    opacity=(range 10 to 100),mode=(edge,classic)

  The default style is:

    mode=classic,style=solid,width=1,opacity=100

  Mode 'edge' ignore: style, --freeze

  Mode 'classic' ignore: opacity

  The 'opacity' specifier is only effective if a Composite Manager is running.

  For the color you can use a name or a hexadecimal value.

    color="red" or color="#ff0000"

  Example:

    $ scrot --line style=dash,width=3,color="red" --select

NOTE FORMAT
  The following specifiers are recognised for the option --note:

    -f 'FontName/size'
    -t 'text'
    -x position (optional)
    -y position (optional)
    -c color(RGBA) (optional)
    -a angle (optional)

  Example:

    $ scrot --note "-f '/usr/share/fonts/TTF/DroidSans-Bold/40' -x 10 -y 20 -c 255,0,0,255 -t 'Hi'"
