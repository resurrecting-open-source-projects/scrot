NAME
  scrot - command line screen capture utility

SYNOPSIS
  scrot [-bcfhikmopsuvz] [-a X,Y,W,H] [-C NAME] [-D DISPLAY] [-d SEC] [-e CMD]
        [-F FILE] [-l STYLE] [-n OPTS] [-q NUM] [-S CMD] [-t NUM | GEOM] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
  scrot (SCReenshOT) is a simple command line screen capture utility, it uses
  imlib2 to grab and save images.

  scrot has many useful features:
    - Support for multiple image formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, and others.
    - The screenshot's quality is configurable.
    - It is possible to capture a specific window or a rectangular area on the
      screen.

  Because scrot is a command line utility, it can easily be scripted and put to
  novel uses. For instance, scrot can be used to monitor an X server in absence.

  scrot is free software under the MIT-advertising license.

OPTIONS
  -a, --autoselect X,Y,W,H  Non-interactively choose a rectangle starting at
                            position X,Y and of W by H resolution.
  -b, --border              When selecting a window, grab the WM's border too.
                            Use with -s to raise the focus of the window.
  -C, --class NAME          NAME is a window class name. Associative with -k.
  -c, --count               Display a countdown when used with -d.
  -D, --display DISPLAY     DISPLAY is the display to use; see X(7).
  -d, --delay SEC           Wait SEC seconds before taking a shot.
  -e, --exec CMD            Execute CMD on the saved image.
  -f, --freeze              Freeze the screen when -s is used.
  -F, --file                File name. See SPECIAL STRINGS.
  -h, --help                Display help and exit.
  -i, --ignorekeyboard      Don't exit for keyboard input. ESC still exits.
  -k, --stack               Capture stack/overlapped windows and join them. A
                            running Composite Manager is needed.
  -l, --line STYLE          STYLE indicates the style of the line when the -s
                            option is used; see SELECTION STYLE.
  -m, --multidisp           For multiple heads, screenshot all of them in order.
  -n, --note OPTS           OPTS is a collection of options which specify notes
                            to bake into the image. See NOTE FORMAT.
  -o, --overwrite           By default scrot does not overwrite the output
                            FILE, use this option to enable it.
  -p, --pointer             Capture the mouse pointer.
  -q, --quality NUM         NUM must be between 1 and 100. For lossless output
                            formats, a higher value represents better but slower
                            compression. For lossy output formats, a higher
                            value represents higher quality and larger
                            file size. Default: 75.
  -S, --script CMD          CMD is an imlib2 script.
  -s, --select OPT          Interactively select a window or rectangle with the
                            mouse, use the arrow keys to resize. See the -l and
                            -f options. OPT it's optional; see SELECTION MODE
  -t, --thumb NUM | GEOM    Also generate a thumbnail. The argument is the
                            resolution of the thumbnail, it may be a percentage
                            NUM or a resolution GEOM. Examples: 10, 25, 320x240,
                            500x200.
  -u, --focused             Use the currently focused window.
  -v, --version             Output version information and exit.
  -z, --silent              Prevent beeping.
  -                         Redirection to standard output. The output image
                            format is PNG.

SPECIAL STRINGS
  -e, -F and FILE parameters can take format specifiers that are expanded
  by scrot when encountered. There are two types of format specifier:
  Characters preceded by a '%' are interpreted by strftime(2). The second kind
  are internal to scrot and are prefixed by '$'. The following specifiers are
  recognised by scrot:

    $$   A literal '$'.
    $a   The system's hostname.
    $f   The image's full path (ignored when used in the filename).
    $h   The image's height.
    $m   The thumbnail's full path (ignored when used in the filename).
    $n   The image's basename (ignored when used in the filename).
    $p   The image's pixel size.
    $s   The image's size in bytes (ignored when used in the filename).
    $t   The image's file format (ignored when used in the filename).
    $w   The image's width.
    \\n   A literal newline (ignored when used in the filename).

  Example:

    $ scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h.png' -e 'optipng $f'

  This would create a PNG file with a name similar to 2000-10-30_2560x1024.png
  and optimize it with optipng(1).

SELECTION MODE
  When using -s, optionally you can indicate the action to perform with the selection area.
    capture         Capture the selection area, this action is by default.
    hole            Highlight the selected area overshadowing the rest of the capture.
    hide            Hide the selection area by drawing an area of color over it.
    blur            Blurs the selection area.

  In both modes(hole/hide) the opacity and the color of the area is indicated by
  the "opacity" and "color" property of the line style, SELECTION STYLE

  Example:

    $ scrot --select=hide
    $ scrot -shole --line color="Dark Salmon",opacity=200

SELECTION STYLE
  When using -s, you can indicate the style of the line with -l.

  -l takes a comma-separated list of specifiers as argument:

    style=STYLE     STYLE is either "solid" or "dash" without quotes.
    width=NUM       NUM is a pixel count between 1 and 8 inclusive.
    color="COLOR"   Color is a hexadecimal HTML color code or the name of
                    a color. HTML color codes are composed of a pound
                    sign '#' followed by a sequence of 3 2-digit
                    hexadecimal numbers which represent red, green, and
                    blue respectively. Examples: #FF0000 (red), #E0FFFF
                    (light cyan), #000000 (black).
    opacity=NUM     NUM is between 0 and 255 inclusive. 255 means
                    100% opaque, 0 means 100% transparent. For the
                    opacity of the line this is only effective if a
                    Composite Manager is running.
    mode=MODE       MODE is either "edge" or "classic" without quotes.
                    edge is the new selection, classic uses the old one.
                    "edge" ignores the style specifier and the -f flag,
                    "classic" ignores the opacity specifier.

  Without the -l option, a default style is used:

    mode=classic,style=solid,width=1,opacity=100

  Example:

    $ scrot -l style=dash,width=3,color="red" -s

NOTE FORMAT
  The -n option's argument is more arguments:

    -f  'FontName/size'
    -t  'text'
    -x  position (optional)
    -y  position (optional)
    -c  color(RGBA, range 0..255) (optional)
    -a  angle (optional)

  Example:

    $ scrot -n "-f '/usr/share/fonts/TTF/DroidSans-Bold/40' -x 10
            -y 20 -c 255,0,0,255 -t 'Hi'"
