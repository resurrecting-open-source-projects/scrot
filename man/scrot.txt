NAME
  scrot - command line screen capture utility

SYNOPSIS
  scrot [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
  scrot (SCReenshOT) is a simple command line screen capture
  utility that uses imlib2 to grab and save images. Multiple
  image formats are supported through imlib2's dynamic saver
  modules.

  Some features of the scrot:
    - support to multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.).
    - optimization of the screen shots image quality.
    - capture a specific window or a rectangular area on the
      screen with the help of switch.

  scrot also can be used to monitor a desktop PC in admin absent
  and register unwanted activities.

  -v, --version      Output version information and exit.
  -a, --autoselect   Non-interactively choose a rectangle of x,y,w,h.
  -b, --border       When selecting a window, grab wm border too.

  -d, --delay NUM    Wait NUM seconds before taking a shot.
  -e, --exec APP     Exec APP on the saved image.
  -q, --quality NUM  Image  quality (1-100) high value means high size, low
                     compression. Default: 75. (Effect differs depending on
                     file format chosen).
  -m, --multidisp    For multiple heads, grab shot from each and join them
                     together.
  -s, --select       Interactively select a window or rectangle with the mouse.
  -u, --focused      Use the currently focused window.
  -t, --thumb NUM    Generate thumbnail too. NUM is the percentage of the
                     original size for the thumbnail to be.
  -z, --silent       Prevent beeping.

SPECIAL STRINGS
  Both the --exec and filename parameters can take format specifiers that are
  expanded by scrot when encountered. There are two types of format specifier.
  Characters preceded by a '%' are interpreted by strftime(2). See man strftime
  for examples. These options may be used to refer to the current date and
  time. The second kind are internal to scrot and are prefixed by '$' The
  following specifiers are recognised:

    $f  image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)
    $n  image name (ignored when used in the filename)
    $s  image size (bytes) (ignored when used in the filename)
    $p  image pixel size
    $w  image width
    $h  image height
    $t  image format (ignored when used in the filename)
    $$  print a literal '$'
    \\n  print a newline (ignored when used in the filename)

EXAMPLE
  scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h.png' -e 'mv $f ~/shots/'  
       This would create a file called something like 2000-10-30_2560x1024.png
       and move it to your shots directory.
